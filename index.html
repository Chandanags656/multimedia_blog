      <strong>Salar</strong> is a <em>Turkic</em> language spoken by the Salar
      people, who mainly live in the provinces of Qinghai and Gansu in China;
      some also live in Ili, Xinjiang. It is a primary branch and an eastern
      outlier of the Oghuz branch of Turkic, the other Oghuz languages being
      spoken mostly in West and Central Asia. The Salar number about 105,000
      people, about 70,000[6] (2002) speak the Salar language; under 20,000[6]
      are monolinguals. According to Salar tradition and Chinese chronicles, the
      Salars are the descendants of the Salur tribe, belonging to the Oghuz Turk
      tribe of the Western Turkic Khaganate. During the Tang dynasty, the Salur
      tribe dwelt within China's borders and since then has lived within the
      Qinghai-Gansu border region.[7][8] Contemporary Salar has some influence
      from Mandarin Chinese and Amdo Tibetan. The film's initial storyline was
      pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014) and is the maiden part of a
      two-part film.[4] It was officially announced in December 2020 under the
      title Salaar, however, in July 2023, its first installment was titled as
      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Principal photography commenced in January
      2021, and occurred sporadically in several legs over nearly three years,
      before wrapping in late 2023. Filming locations included Telangana, Italy
      and Budapest. Production difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots
      and VFX delays, postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music
      is composed by Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and
      editing by Ujwal Kulkarni.
